# Tesla-Dataset
*This project provides a detailed EDA of the Tesla's Stocks over the past 10 years and fits a Linear Regression Model by manually creating a model rather than using a Scikit library for the same.
*Here we manually create a Linear Regression  model using the concept of the GRADIENT DESCENT.

*We just use the "HIGH COLUMN" as the determinant and the "CLOSING PRICE" as the dependent. 
*We basically use the high column to predict the values of the closing prices of the stocks.

*Finally we visualize the predicted data to se how accurate the model is.
